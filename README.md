This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in different programming languages.

Assembly Line: A scheduling algorithm used in manufacturing to optimize production on assembly lines.

Binary Search: An efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

KnapSack Algorithm: A dynamic programming algorithm used to solve the knapsack problem, maximizing the value of items placed into a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.

Kruskal: A greedy algorithm used to find a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.

Linear Search: A simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the list is exhausted.

Longest Common Subsequence: An algorithm to find the longest subsequence that is common to two sequences.

MaxMin: An algorithm to find both the maximum and minimum elements in an array with fewer comparisons than separately finding each.

Merge Sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted subarrays.

Merging Two Lists: An algorithm to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

MultiStageGraph: An algorithm to solve optimization problems modeled as multi-stage graphs, often used in operations research and project management.

N Queens: An algorithm to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Power of Number: An algorithm to calculate the power of a number using recursion or iteration.

QuickSort: A sorting algorithm that partitions an array into smaller parts, then recursively sorts the parts.

QuickSort Iterative: An iterative version of the quicksort algorithm that doesn't use recursion.

Single Source Shortest Path: An algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

Tower of Hanoi Test Cases: Test cases for the Tower of Hanoi problem, which involves moving a stack of disks from one rod to another.

Permutation Generator Test Cases: Test cases for generating permutations of a set of elements.

Selection Sort Test Cases: Test cases for the selection sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and moves it to the sorted portion.

Sum by Recursion Test Cases: Test cases for calculating the sum of elements in an array using recursion.

Truth Table Test Cases: Test cases for generating truth tables for logical expressions.
